Feature: Rent a space
  As Alice
  I want to rent a space
  So that I can organize and name assets easily.

  Background:
    Given renting a space costs 0.1 xem per block
    And the mean block generation time is 15 seconds
    And the maximum space duration is 1 year
    And the space name can have up to 64 characters
    And the following space names are reserved
      | xem  |
      | nem  |
      | user |
      | org  |
      | com  |
      | biz  |
      | net  |
      | edu  |
      | mil  |
      | gov  |
      | info |
    And Alice has 10000000 xem in her account

  Scenario Outline: An account rents a space
    When Alice rents a space named <name> for <time> seconds
    Then she should become the owner of the new space <name>
    And it should be rented for <time> seconds
    And her xem balance should decrease in <cost> units

    Examples:
      | name  | time  | cost |
